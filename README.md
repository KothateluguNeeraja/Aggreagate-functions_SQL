# Aggreagate-functions_SQL
# SQL Aggregate Functions and Grouping

I imported a CSV file named additional into MySQL Workbench to practice SQL queries. The table includes fields like Sales Rep, Region, sales, and profit.
Using this data, I learned how to:
Write queries using aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), and COUNT()
Group the data using GROUP BY
Filter grouped results using HAVING
Count unique values and apply ROUND() to format output
This helped me understand how to analyze sales and profit data by region and sales representative using SQL.
